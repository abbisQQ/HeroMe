# HeroMe
Hero me App-exercise to demontrate how to switch from one fragment to another and from one activity to another plus a good looking ui :)
 
You get to choose what kind of powers you possess and how you obtain them, then you see what hero you are based on your answers. 

For this projects i used both activities and fragment, switch from one to another and vice versa, using intents and fragment manager. Most of the project focus on its ui, i manage to do it using linear and relative layout as well as framelayout.
